# Styled responsive images

Inserting an image in the text editor dialog today allows the user to fiddle
with image dimensions. It doesn't even have aspect ratio locking.

It's not great for the authoring experience nor for structured content reasons
that users are defining the specific dimensions of every single image they
insert. It'd be much better to allow them to choose from image styles â€” just
like we do for image fields.

This module lets users select a responsive style OR a image style to place
images in the content.

[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/inline_responsive_images).

This module is essentially an answer to
[issue 2061377](https://www.drupal.org/node/2061377).
When that issue makes it in into core, this module is no longer needed.

## Requirements

This module requires the following core modules to be enabled:
- Image
- Text Editor (along with CKEditor 5 module or CKEditor 4 module)

For responsive images, of course, you must also enable the core Responsive Image module.


## Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. For further
information, see
[Installing Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-drupal-modules).


## Configuration

- The module has no menu or modifiable settings.
- Enable the text format filter 'Display responsive images' or 'Display image
  styles' and select the images styles/responsive styles that you want to be
  available to the user.
- Note: either don't enable the 'Restrict images to this site' and
  'Track images uploaded via a Text Editor' filters or make sure to change the
  order so the filters of this module run after those filters.
- When the module is enabled, create new content. In the editor, click on the
  image icon in the toolbar. A popup will open where the user can upload an
  image.
- With CKEditor 4, there's a field in the popup to assign an image style or
  responsive style by selecting style from the dropdown menu.
- With CKEditor 5, the dropdown menu is in the image toolbar. For now, the image
  will not appear styled in the editor, but it will when the actual text field
  is rendered on the frontend.


## CKEditor5 Plugin Development

To compile CKEditor plugin javascript follow [instructions](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/getting-started/installation/quick-start.html)

Make sure CKEditor5 version is compatible with Drupal's by monitoring Drupal [issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?text=Update&component=ckeditor5.module)

* Upgrade is required when Drupal 10.4 is released (see [issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3459926))
